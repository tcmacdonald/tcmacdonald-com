> When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. – https://jamstack.org/

You can think of the JAMStack as "pre-rendered HTML".

Every time you update content in the CMS, we build a new version of the entire site and deploy it to production. If you made a mistake, you can rollback that deployment with a couple clicks.

Building projects on the JAMStack provides...

## Better Performance

You entire project is deployed to a global CDN. This reduces latency and serves content based on the geographic locations of the user.

## Higher Security

With server-side processes abstracted into micro-service APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced.

## Cheaper, Easier Scaling

Since all content and assets are served from the edge, we can achieve near infinite scale at a fraction of the cost of scaling a monolithic applications.

## Developer Satisfaction

The JAMStack supports a wide array of front-end frameworks & headless CMSs. Coupled with serverless technologies and APIs, we get dynamic behavior without managing infrastracture.

## Future Proof

Dynamic software gets old and turns into technical debt. Prerendered websites can function for as long as browsers can render HTML.
